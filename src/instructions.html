      This is a banking project and it has some functionalities like Adding
      money in your account, transferring money to others account and viewing
      transaction statements. For the sake of simplicity, you cannot create a
      new account. However, there are 3 ready-made accounts which can be used to
      test the functionality of this app -
    </p>
